# Email Spam Classifier
## Overview
The Email Spam Classifier is a natural language processing (NLP) project designed to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham). It leverages various machine learning algorithms and techniques to achieve accurate classification based on the content of the email.


## Features
Binary Classification: Classifies emails into two categories: spam (1) or not spam (0).
Multiple Models: Utilizes Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and LSTM models to evaluate and compare performance.
Text Preprocessing: Implements comprehensive preprocessing steps including:
Removal of special characters and non-alphabetic characters.
Expansion of contractions for better tokenization.
Tokenization of text into words.
Lowercasing of words and removal of stopwords.
Lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.
